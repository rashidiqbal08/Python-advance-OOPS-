##CLASSES/OBJECTS

# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
# CLASSES ARE LIKE A TEMPLATE
# OBJECTS ARE INSTANCES OF CLASSES
